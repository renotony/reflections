When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  You would want to use a remote repository when you are working from more than
  one location or when more than one person is making updates to your files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You would want to control exactly when GitHub gets a "final" version of
  any file you might be working on - you would not want Git automatically
  pushing commits from the working directory just because a change happened.
